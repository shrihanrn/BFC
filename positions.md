## Point Guard
> The point guard is the main facilitator of the team. This person almost always has the ball at the start of the play, and has the responsibility of disributing the ball between the other players on the team. The point guard also is looked at the floor general of the team, since he is the one that is always making plays for people like the shooting guard and small forward. Therefore, the main job of the point guard is to pass, but point guards these days are proficient scorers on the ball, and they use their quickness to their advantage by getting easy buckets. Some of the most famous point guards are **Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, and John Stockton**.

## Shooting Guard
> The shooting guard is the main person person on your team that should be able to shoot the ball efficiently and with precision. This player often makes the shots for the team, and is relied on to do so, since that is their main job. In addition to this, the shooting guard shooting well can also space the floor for the team, since more players will have to guard him from outside the three point line, and this leaves ample space for the power forward and center to attack the paint, giving free points to the team. Therefore, many shooting guards have high point per game, and many of the greatest shooting guards are all high volume scorers. These famous shooting guards are **Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Dwayne Wade, and Ray Allen**.

## Small Forward
> The Small Forward is the "jack of all trades" player on your team, and this player should pretty much be able to do everything that is needed efficiently. This includes stuff like scoring the ball at a high volume, passing the ball to your teammates and getting shots for them, and playing good defense and securing defensive possessions to the team, which can be important in winning a game. The purpose of this for the small forwards is because they should be able to fill in for a player whenever they feel off, or are not doing their role properly. This back-up function helps run a team smoothly and helps win games. Some famous small forwards are **Lebron James, Kevin Durant, and Kawhi Leonard**.

## Power Forward
> The Power Forward is normally the second tallest person on your team, and this player mainly tries to score in the paint and post-up (driving with your back to the basket) to get points. Additionally, the power forward, similar to the center, is a post presence on defense for your team, and should be able to block many shots and grab defensive/offensive rebounds for your team. This player is scrappy, and does the "dirty work" if you will. Some of the famous power forward are **Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, and Kevin Garnett**

## Center 
> The Center is the tallest person on the team, and for good reason, since this player mainly scores near the basket through an assortment of layups and dunks, and also is the main defensive anchor on the team when it comes to pain shots. The Center will probably have the most blocks on your team, and some star centers in today's league also have devloped a midrange-3-pt shot, showing how adaptable today's league can be. Some of the most famous centers of all time are **Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, and Wilt Chamberlain**.
